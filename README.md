## Tips

If multiple timers are required, pause the next timer beforehand so that the timer does not start unintentionally.

```md

* [ ] [-p25] yyy
* [ ] [-p25] zzz
```

If you're using the [vim](https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins/vim) plugin and the autocomplete hint doesn't close, add the below keymap in your `keymap.cson` file.

```cson
  ".CodeMirror textarea.visible-hint": {
    "escape": "pomodoro-edit:close-hint"
  }
```

## Key customizations

Default keymaps are defined [here](https://github.com/seachicken/inkdrop-pomodoro-edit/blob/master/keymaps/pomodoro-edit.json) and you can override them in your `keymap.cson` file.
